# Changelog

Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), versioned per [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Office export

- New `--preset slide|a4|square` (defaults to PNG unless `-f` is explicit; `slide` enlarges node type/spacing and reserves a footer safe area)
- New caption chrome `--title` / `--subtitle` / `--source` / `--unit` on PNG (shared by mermaid and extension blocks). **Breaking:** `--title` is no longer injected as mermaid frontmatter
- New `--brand <hex>`: remaps extension-block accent only; flowchart shape coding stays; low-contrast warns without blocking
- New `--strict-chart` and `--json.warnings`: soft budget gate for pie / xychart / radar / flowchart / sequence
- New fences: ```chart ```kpi ```compare ```funnel ```task ```progress ```swimlane
- `--help` now documents `--preset`, `--index`, and the flags above
- skill / AGENT_GUIDE rewritten around office intent: overview ≤9 nodes, when not to draw, degradation ladder, PNG default
- tech theme tightened: drop neo gradient/shadow, shape-coding as pale fill + hairline, quieter grays; extension blocks unify on 8px radius / no shadow, kpi accents only the first metric
- New extension-block gallery [docs/EXTENSIONS.en.md](docs/EXTENSIONS.en.md) (one tool-rendered PNG per fence)
- Tests turn on `profile` probes: fail if `page-reset` / `init-mermaid` counts or per-stage maxMs blow the budget; after HTML blocks the mermaid shell is rearmed by a cheap DOM reset, not a per-block re-inject

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09

First stable release.

### Theme system (tech default theme, official entry points first)

- Colors organized along mermaid's official three-layer entries: **full themeVariables surface** (core derivation chain primaryColor/secondary/tertiary/mainBkg/nodeBkg + per-diagram variables) → per-diagram config sections (c4/journey/radar/xyChart…) → themeCSS only for what official variables can't express (corner radius, shape coding, a few structural fixes)
- Data-class diagrams use the **AntV G2 categorical palette** (pie/xychart/treemap/radar) — modern report look
- Node `look: 'neo'`: rounded corners + soft gradients + shadows; flowcharts keep shape coding (blue = process, amber = decision, green = state, purple = storage)
- All 20 mermaid diagram types covered + pixel-level theme census script (`scripts/theme-census.ts`) as a regression guard

### Render pipeline

- Bundled Noto Sans SC font subset (GB2312 + latin, 1.9 MB woff2) for machine-consistent Chinese rendering
- ELK layout engine lazily loaded (flowchart/graph only); dagre for the rest
- Lossless 2x PNG + pixel-level padding crop (symmetric margins by construction); SVG minified by svgo (official browser build embedded in the binary)
- Serialized concurrent screenshots + adaptive viewport, 60s render-timeout circuit breaker + per-diagram retry

### Extension blocks

- ```table / ```list / ```card (convention syntax: `emoji | title | description`) rendered as styled PNG

### Agent friendly

- `--json` machine-readable output, `--profile` stage timings, `--theme-js`/`--config`/`--css` theme customization, `--icon` icon packs
- Per-diagram failure isolation — the batch never aborts; bundled agent skill (trigger words, picking table, self-check loop)

### Artifacts

- `mmdx-windows-x64.exe` — windows x64 single file (no Node; needs system Edge/Chrome)
